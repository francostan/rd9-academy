# AI SDK

The AI SDK is the TypeScript toolkit designed to help developers build AI-powered applications and agents with React, Next.js, Vue, Svelte, Node.js, and more.

## Why use the AI SDK?

Integrating large language models (LLMs) into applications is complicated and heavily dependent on the specific model provider you use.

The AI SDK standardizes integrating artificial intelligence (AI) models across [supported providers](/docs/foundations/providers-and-models). This enables developers to focus on building great AI applications, not waste time on technical details.

For example, hereâ€™s how you can generate text with various models using the AI SDK:

<PreviewSwitchProviders />

The AI SDK has two main libraries:

- **[AI SDK Core](/docs/ai-sdk-core):** A unified API for generating text, structured objects, tool calls, and building agents with LLMs.
- **[AI SDK UI](/docs/ai-sdk-ui):** A set of framework-agnostic hooks for quickly building chat and generative user interface.

## Model Providers

The AI SDK supports [multiple model providers](/providers).

<OfficialModelCards />

## Templates

We've built some [templates](https://vercel.com/templates?type=ai) that include AI SDK integrations for different use cases, providers, and frameworks. You can use these templates to get started with your AI-powered application.

### Starter Kits

<Templates type="starter-kits" />

### Feature Exploration

<Templates type="feature-exploration" />

### Frameworks

<Templates type="frameworks" />

### Generative UI

## Join our Community

If you have questions about anything related to the AI SDK, you're always welcome to ask our community on [the Vercel Community](https://community.vercel.com/c/ai-sdk/62).

## `llms.txt` (for Cursor, Windsurf, Copilot, Claude etc.)

You can access the entire AI SDK documentation in Markdown format at [ai-sdk.dev/llms.txt](/llms.txt). This can be used to ask any LLM (assuming it has a big enough context window) questions about the AI SDK based on the most up-to-date documentation.

### Example Usage

For instance, to prompt an LLM with questions about the AI SDK:

1. Copy the documentation contents from [ai-sdk.dev/llms.txt](/llms.txt)
2. Use the following prompt format:

```prompt
Documentation:
{paste documentation here}
---
Based on the above documentation, answer the following:
{your question}
```

To effectively leverage the AI SDK, it helps to familiarize yourself with the following concepts:
## Large Language Models

A **large language model (LLM)** is a subset of generative models focused primarily on **text**. An LLM takes a sequence of words as input and aims to predict the most likely sequence to follow. It assigns probabilities to potential next sequences and then selects one. The model continues to generate sequences until it meets a specified stopping criterion.

LLMs learn by training on massive collections of written text, which means they will be better suited to some use cases than others. For example, a model trained on GitHub data would understand the probabilities of sequences in source code particularly well.

However, it's crucial to understand LLMs' limitations. When asked about less known or absent information, like the birthday of a personal relative, LLMs might "hallucinate" or make up information. It's essential to consider how well-represented the information you need is in the model.

## Embedding Models

An **embedding model** is used to convert complex data (like words or images) into a dense vector (a list of numbers) representation, known as an embedding. Unlike generative models, embedding models do not generate new text or data. Instead, they provide representations of semantic and syntactic relationships between entities that can be used as input for other models or other natural language processing tasks.

In the next section, you will learn about the difference between models providers and models, and which ones are available in the AI SDK.

Our [language model specification](https://github.com/vercel/ai/tree/main/packages/provider/src/language-model/v2) is published as an open-source package, which you can use to create [custom providers](/providers/community-providers/custom-providers).

# Prompts

Prompts are instructions that you give a [large language model (LLM)](/docs/foundations/overview#large-language-models) to tell it what to do.
It's like when you ask someone for directions; the clearer your question, the better the directions you'll get.

Many LLM providers offer complex interfaces for specifying prompts. They involve different roles and message types.
While these interfaces are powerful, they can be hard to use and understand.

In order to simplify prompting, the AI SDK supports text, message, and system prompts.

## Text Prompts

Text prompts are strings.
They are ideal for simple generation use cases,
e.g. repeatedly generating content for variants of the same prompt text.

You can set text prompts using the `prompt` property made available by AI SDK functions like [`streamText`](/docs/reference/ai-sdk-core/stream-text) or [`generateObject`](/docs/reference/ai-sdk-core/generate-object).
You can structure the text in any way and inject variables, e.g. using a template literal.

```ts highlight="3"
const result = await generateText({
  model: __MODEL__,
  prompt: 'Invent a new holiday and describe its traditions.',
});
```

You can also use template literals to provide dynamic data to your prompt.

```ts highlight="3-5"
const result = await generateText({
  model: __MODEL__,
  prompt:
    `I am planning a trip to ${destination} for ${lengthOfStay} days. ` +
    `Please suggest the best tourist activities for me to do.`,
});
```

## System Prompts

System prompts are the initial set of instructions given to models that help guide and constrain the models' behaviors and responses.
You can set system prompts using the `system` property.
System prompts work with both the `prompt` and the `messages` properties.

```ts highlight="3-6"
const result = await generateText({
  model: __MODEL__,
  system:
    `You help planning travel itineraries. ` +
    `Respond to the users' request with a list ` +
    `of the best stops to make in their destination.`,
  prompt:
    `I am planning a trip to ${destination} for ${lengthOfStay} days. ` +
    `Please suggest the best tourist activities for me to do.`,
});
```

<Note>
  When you use a message prompt, you can also use system messages instead of a
  system prompt.
</Note>

## Message Prompts

A message prompt is an array of user, assistant, and tool messages.
They are great for chat interfaces and more complex, multi-modal prompts.
You can use the `messages` property to set message prompts.

Each message has a `role` and a `content` property. The content can either be text (for user and assistant messages), or an array of relevant parts (data) for that message type.

```ts highlight="3-7"
const result = await generateText({
  model: __MODEL__,
  messages: [
    { role: 'user', content: 'Hi!' },
    { role: 'assistant', content: 'Hello, how can I help?' },
    { role: 'user', content: 'Where can I buy the best Currywurst in Berlin?' },
  ],
});
```

Instead of sending a text in the `content` property, you can send an array of parts that includes a mix of text and other content parts.

<Note type="warning">
  Not all language models support all message and content types. For example,
  some models might not be capable of handling multi-modal inputs or tool
  messages. [Learn more about the capabilities of select
  models](./providers-and-models#model-capabilities).
</Note>

### Provider Options

You can pass through additional provider-specific metadata to enable provider-specific functionality at 3 levels.

#### Function Call Level

Functions like [`streamText`](/docs/reference/ai-sdk-core/stream-text#provider-options) or [`generateText`](/docs/reference/ai-sdk-core/generate-text#provider-options) accept a `providerOptions` property.

Adding provider options at the function call level should be used when you do not need granular control over where the provider options are applied.

```ts
const { text } = await generateText({
  model: azure('your-deployment-name'),
  providerOptions: {
    openai: {
      reasoningEffort: 'low',
    },
  },
});
```

#### Message Level

For granular control over applying provider options at the message level, you can pass `providerOptions` to the message object:

```ts
import { ModelMessage } from 'ai';

const messages: ModelMessage[] = [
  {
    role: 'system',
    content: 'Cached system message',
    providerOptions: {
      // Sets a cache control breakpoint on the system message
      anthropic: { cacheControl: { type: 'ephemeral' } },
    },
  },
];
```

#### Message Part Level

Certain provider-specific options require configuration at the message part level:

```ts
import { ModelMessage } from 'ai';

const messages: ModelMessage[] = [
  {
    role: 'user',
    content: [
      {
        type: 'text',
        text: 'Describe the image in detail.',
        providerOptions: {
          openai: { imageDetail: 'low' },
        },
      },
      {
        type: 'image',
        image:
          'https://github.com/vercel/ai/blob/main/examples/ai-core/data/comic-cat.png?raw=true',
        // Sets image detail configuration for image part:
        providerOptions: {
          openai: { imageDetail: 'low' },
        },
      },
    ],
  },
];
```

<Note type="warning">
  AI SDK UI hooks like [`useChat`](/docs/reference/ai-sdk-ui/use-chat) return
  arrays of `UIMessage` objects, which do not support provider options. We
  recommend using the
  [`convertToModelMessages`](/docs/reference/ai-sdk-ui/convert-to-core-messages)
  function to convert `UIMessage` objects to
  [`ModelMessage`](/docs/reference/ai-sdk-core/model-message) objects before
  applying or appending message(s) or message parts with `providerOptions`.
</Note>

### User Messages

#### Text Parts

Text content is the most common type of content. It is a string that is passed to the model.

If you only need to send text content in a message, the `content` property can be a string,
but you can also use it to send multiple content parts.

```ts highlight="7-10"
const result = await generateText({
  model: __MODEL__,
  messages: [
    {
      role: 'user',
      content: [
        {
          type: 'text',
          text: 'Where can I buy the best Currywurst in Berlin?',
        },
      ],
    },
  ],
});
```

#### Image Parts

User messages can include image parts. An image can be one of the following:

- base64-encoded image:
  - `string` with base-64 encoded content
  - data URL `string`, e.g. `data:image/png;base64,...`
- binary image:
  - `ArrayBuffer`
  - `Uint8Array`
  - `Buffer`
- URL:
  - http(s) URL `string`, e.g. `https://example.com/image.png`
  - `URL` object, e.g. `new URL('https://example.com/image.png')`

##### Example: Binary image (Buffer)

```ts highlight="8-11"
const result = await generateText({
  model,
  messages: [
    {
      role: 'user',
      content: [
        { type: 'text', text: 'Describe the image in detail.' },
        {
          type: 'image',
          image: fs.readFileSync('./data/comic-cat.png'),
        },
      ],
    },
  ],
});
```

##### Example: Base-64 encoded image (string)

```ts highlight="8-11"
const result = await generateText({
  model: __MODEL__,
  messages: [
    {
      role: 'user',
      content: [
        { type: 'text', text: 'Describe the image in detail.' },
        {
          type: 'image',
          image: fs.readFileSync('./data/comic-cat.png').toString('base64'),
        },
      ],
    },
  ],
});
```

##### Example: Image URL (string)

```ts highlight="8-12"
const result = await generateText({
  model: __MODEL__,
  messages: [
    {
      role: 'user',
      content: [
        { type: 'text', text: 'Describe the image in detail.' },
        {
          type: 'image',
          image:
            'https://github.com/vercel/ai/blob/main/examples/ai-core/data/comic-cat.png?raw=true',
        },
      ],
    },
  ],
});
```

#### File Parts

<Note type="warning">
  Only a few providers and models currently support file parts: [Google
  Generative AI](/providers/ai-sdk-providers/google-generative-ai), [Google
  Vertex AI](/providers/ai-sdk-providers/google-vertex),
  [OpenAI](/providers/ai-sdk-providers/openai) (for `wav` and `mp3` audio with
  `gpt-4o-audio-preview`), [Anthropic](/providers/ai-sdk-providers/anthropic),
  [OpenAI](/providers/ai-sdk-providers/openai) (for `pdf`).
</Note>

User messages can include file parts. A file can be one of the following:

- base64-encoded file:
  - `string` with base-64 encoded content
  - data URL `string`, e.g. `data:image/png;base64,...`
- binary data:
  - `ArrayBuffer`
  - `Uint8Array`
  - `Buffer`
- URL:
  - http(s) URL `string`, e.g. `https://example.com/some.pdf`
  - `URL` object, e.g. `new URL('https://example.com/some.pdf')`

You need to specify the MIME type of the file you are sending.

##### Example: PDF file from Buffer

```ts highlight="12-15"
import { google } from '@ai-sdk/google';
import { generateText } from 'ai';

const result = await generateText({
  model: google('gemini-1.5-flash'),
  messages: [
    {
      role: 'user',
      content: [
        { type: 'text', text: 'What is the file about?' },
        {
          type: 'file',
          mediaType: 'application/pdf',
          data: fs.readFileSync('./data/example.pdf'),
          filename: 'example.pdf', // optional, not used by all providers
        },
      ],
    },
  ],
});
```

##### Example: mp3 audio file from Buffer

```ts highlight="12-14"
import { openai } from '@ai-sdk/openai';
import { generateText } from 'ai';

const result = await generateText({
  model: openai('gpt-4o-audio-preview'),
  messages: [
    {
      role: 'user',
      content: [
        { type: 'text', text: 'What is the audio saying?' },
        {
          type: 'file',
          mediaType: 'audio/mpeg',
          data: fs.readFileSync('./data/galileo.mp3'),
        },
      ],
    },
  ],
});
```

#### Custom Download Function (Experimental)

You can use custom download functions to implement throttling, retries, authentication, caching, and more.

The default download implementation automatically downloads files in parallel when they are not supported by the model.

Custom download function can be passed via the `experimental_download` property:

```ts
const result = await generateText({
  model: __MODEL__,
  experimental_download: async (
    requestedDownloads: Array<{
      url: URL;
      isUrlSupportedByModel: boolean;
    }>,
  ): PromiseLike<
    Array<{
      data: Uint8Array;
      mediaType: string | undefined;
    } | null>
  > => {
    // ... download the files and return an array with similar order
  },
  messages: [
    {
      role: 'user',
      content: [
        {
          type: 'file',
          data: new URL('https://api.company.com/private/document.pdf'),
          mediaType: 'application/pdf',
        },
      ],
    },
  ],
});
```

<Note>
  The `experimental_download` option is experimental and may change in future
  releases.
</Note>

### Assistant Messages

Assistant messages are messages that have a role of `assistant`.
They are typically previous responses from the assistant
and can contain text, reasoning, and tool call parts.

#### Example: Assistant message with text content

```ts highlight="5"
const result = await generateText({
  model: __MODEL__,
  messages: [
    { role: 'user', content: 'Hi!' },
    { role: 'assistant', content: 'Hello, how can I help?' },
  ],
});
```

#### Example: Assistant message with text content in array

```ts highlight="7"
const result = await generateText({
  model: __MODEL__,
  messages: [
    { role: 'user', content: 'Hi!' },
    {
      role: 'assistant',
      content: [{ type: 'text', text: 'Hello, how can I help?' }],
    },
  ],
});
```

#### Example: Assistant message with tool call content

```ts highlight="7-14"
const result = await generateText({
  model: __MODEL__,
  messages: [
    { role: 'user', content: 'How many calories are in this block of cheese?' },
    {
      role: 'assistant',
      content: [
        {
          type: 'tool-call',
          toolCallId: '12345',
          toolName: 'get-nutrition-data',
          input: { cheese: 'Roquefort' },
        },
      ],
    },
  ],
});
```

#### Example: Assistant message with file content

<Note>
  This content part is for model-generated files. Only a few models support
  this, and only for file types that they can generate.
</Note>

```ts highlight="9-11"
const result = await generateText({
  model: __MODEL__,
  messages: [
    { role: 'user', content: 'Generate an image of a roquefort cheese!' },
    {
      role: 'assistant',
      content: [
        {
          type: 'file',
          mediaType: 'image/png',
          data: fs.readFileSync('./data/roquefort.jpg'),
        },
      ],
    },
  ],
});
```

### Tool messages

<Note>
  [Tools](/docs/foundations/tools) (also known as function calling) are programs
  that you can provide an LLM to extend its built-in functionality. This can be
  anything from calling an external API to calling functions within your UI.
  Learn more about Tools in [the next section](/docs/foundations/tools).
</Note>

For models that support [tool](/docs/foundations/tools) calls, assistant messages can contain tool call parts, and tool messages can contain tool output parts.
A single assistant message can call multiple tools, and a single tool message can contain multiple tool results.

```ts highlight="14-42"
const result = await generateText({
  model: __MODEL__,
  messages: [
    {
      role: 'user',
      content: [
        {
          type: 'text',
          text: 'How many calories are in this block of cheese?',
        },
        { type: 'image', image: fs.readFileSync('./data/roquefort.jpg') },
      ],
    },
    {
      role: 'assistant',
      content: [
        {
          type: 'tool-call',
          toolCallId: '12345',
          toolName: 'get-nutrition-data',
          input: { cheese: 'Roquefort' },
        },
        // there could be more tool calls here (parallel calling)
      ],
    },
    {
      role: 'tool',
      content: [
        {
          type: 'tool-result',
          toolCallId: '12345', // needs to match the tool call id
          toolName: 'get-nutrition-data',
          output: {
            type: 'json',
            value: {
              name: 'Cheese, roquefort',
              calories: 369,
              fat: 31,
              protein: 22,
            },
          },
        },
        // there could be more tool results here (parallel calling)
      ],
    },
  ],
});
```

#### Multi-modal Tool Results

<Note type="warning">
  Multi-part tool results are experimental and only supported by Anthropic.
</Note>

Tool results can be multi-part and multi-modal, e.g. a text and an image.
You can use the `experimental_content` property on tool parts to specify multi-part tool results.

```ts highlight="24-46"
const result = await generateText({
  model: __MODEL__,
  messages: [
    // ...
    {
      role: 'tool',
      content: [
        {
          type: 'tool-result',
          toolCallId: '12345', // needs to match the tool call id
          toolName: 'get-nutrition-data',
          // for models that do not support multi-part tool results,
          // you can include a regular output part:
          output: {
            type: 'json',
            value: {
              name: 'Cheese, roquefort',
              calories: 369,
              fat: 31,
              protein: 22,
            },
          },
        },
        {
          type: 'tool-result',
          toolCallId: '12345', // needs to match the tool call id
          toolName: 'get-nutrition-data',
          // for models that support multi-part tool results,
          // you can include a multi-part content part:
          output: {
            type: 'content',
            value: [
              {
                type: 'text',
                text: 'Here is an image of the nutrition data for the cheese:',
              },
              {
                type: 'media',
                data: fs
                  .readFileSync('./data/roquefort-nutrition-data.png')
                  .toString('base64'),
                mediaType: 'image/png',
              },
            ],
          },
        },
      ],
    },
  ],
});
```

### System Messages

System messages are messages that are sent to the model before the user messages to guide the assistant's behavior.
You can alternatively use the `system` property.

```ts highlight="4"
const result = await generateText({
  model: __MODEL__,
  messages: [
    { role: 'system', content: 'You help planning travel itineraries.' },
    {
      role: 'user',
      content:
        'I am planning a trip to Berlin for 3 days. Please suggest the best tourist activities for me to do.',
    },
  ],
});
```

# Tools

While [large language models (LLMs)](/docs/foundations/overview#large-language-models) have incredible generation capabilities,
they struggle with discrete tasks (e.g. mathematics) and interacting with the outside world (e.g. getting the weather).

Tools are actions that an LLM can invoke.
The results of these actions can be reported back to the LLM to be considered in the next response.

For example, when you ask an LLM for the "weather in London", and there is a weather tool available, it could call a tool
with London as the argument. The tool would then fetch the weather data and return it to the LLM. The LLM can then use this
information in its response.

## What is a tool?

A tool is an object that can be called by the model to perform a specific task.
You can use tools with [`generateText`](/docs/reference/ai-sdk-core/generate-text)
and [`streamText`](/docs/reference/ai-sdk-core/stream-text) by passing one or more tools to the `tools` parameter.

A tool consists of three properties:

- **`description`**: An optional description of the tool that can influence when the tool is picked.
- **`inputSchema`**: A [Zod schema](/docs/foundations/tools#schema-specification-and-validation-with-zod) or a [JSON schema](/docs/reference/ai-sdk-core/json-schema) that defines the input required for the tool to run. The schema is consumed by the LLM, and also used to validate the LLM tool calls.
- **`execute`**: An optional async function that is called with the arguments from the tool call.

<Note>
  `streamUI` uses UI generator tools with a `generate` function that can return
  React components.
</Note>

If the LLM decides to use a tool, it will generate a tool call.
Tools with an `execute` function are run automatically when these calls are generated.
The output of the tool calls are returned using tool result objects.

You can automatically pass tool results back to the LLM
using [multi-step calls](/docs/ai-sdk-core/tools-and-tool-calling#multi-step-calls) with `streamText` and `generateText`.

## Schemas

Schemas are used to define and validate the [tool input](/docs/ai-sdk-core/tools-and-tool-calling), tools outputs, and structured output generation.

The AI SDK supports the following schemas:

- [Zod](https://zod.dev/) v3 and v4 directly or via [`zodSchema()`](/docs/reference/ai-sdk-core/zod-schema)
- [Valibot](https://valibot.dev/) via [`valibotSchema()`](/docs/reference/ai-sdk-core/valibot-schema) from `@ai-sdk/valibot`
- [Standard JSON Schema](https://standardschema.dev/json-schema) compatible schemas
- Raw JSON schemas via [`jsonSchema()`](/docs/reference/ai-sdk-core/json-schema)

<Note>
  You can also use schemas for structured output generation with
  [`generateText`](/docs/reference/ai-sdk-core/generate-text) and
  [`streamText`](/docs/reference/ai-sdk-core/stream-text) using the `output`
  setting.
</Note>

## Tool Packages

Given tools are JavaScript objects, they can be packaged and distributed through npm like any other library. This makes it easy to share reusable tools across projects and with the community.

### Using Ready-Made Tool Packages

Install a tool package and import the tools you need:

```bash
pnpm add some-tool-package
```

Then pass them directly to `generateText`, `streamText`, or your agent definition:

```ts highlight="2, 8"
import { generateText, stepCountIs } from 'ai';
import { searchTool } from 'some-tool-package';

const { text } = await generateText({
  model: 'anthropic/claude-haiku-4.5',
  prompt: 'When was Vercel Ship AI?',
  tools: {
    webSearch: searchTool,
  },
  stopWhen: stepCountIs(10),
});
```

### Publishing Your Own Tools

You can publish your own tool packages to npm for others to use. Simply export your tool objects from your package:

```ts
// my-tools/index.ts
export const myTool = {
  description: 'A helpful tool',
  inputSchema: z.object({
    query: z.string(),
  }),
  execute: async ({ query }) => {
    // your tool logic
    return result;
  },
};
```

Anyone can then install and use your tools by importing them.

To get started, you can use the [AI SDK Tool Package Template](https://github.com/vercel-labs/ai-sdk-tool-as-package-template) which provides a ready-to-use starting point for publishing your own tools.

# Streaming

Streaming conversational text UIs (like ChatGPT) have gained massive popularity over the past few months. This section explores the benefits and drawbacks of streaming and blocking interfaces.

[Large language models (LLMs)](/docs/foundations/overview#large-language-models) are extremely powerful. However, when generating long outputs, they can be very slow compared to the latency you're likely used to. If you try to build a traditional blocking UI, your users might easily find themselves staring at loading spinners for 5, 10, even up to 40s waiting for the entire LLM response to be generated. This can lead to a poor user experience, especially in conversational applications like chatbots. Streaming UIs can help mitigate this issue by **displaying parts of the response as they become available**.

<div className="grid lg:grid-cols-2 grid-cols-1 gap-4 mt-8">
  <Card
    title="Blocking UI"
    description="Blocking responses wait until the full response is available before displaying it."
  >
    <BrowserIllustration highlight blocking />
  </Card>
  <Card
    title="Streaming UI"
    description="Streaming responses can transmit parts of the response as they become available."
  >
    <BrowserIllustration highlight />
  </Card>
</div>

## Real-world Examples

Here are 2 examples that illustrate how streaming UIs can improve user experiences in a real-world setting â€“Â the first uses a blocking UI, while the second uses a streaming UI.

### Blocking UI

<InlinePrompt
  initialInput="Come up with the first 200 characters of the first book in the Harry Potter series."
  blocking
/>

### Streaming UI

<InlinePrompt initialInput="Come up with the first 200 characters of the first book in the Harry Potter series." />

As you can see, the streaming UI is able to start displaying the response much faster than the blocking UI. This is because the blocking UI has to wait for the entire response to be generated before it can display anything, while the streaming UI can display parts of the response as they become available.

While streaming interfaces can greatly enhance user experiences, especially with larger language models, they aren't always necessary or beneficial. If you can achieve your desired functionality using a smaller, faster model without resorting to streaming, this route can often lead to simpler and more manageable development processes.

However, regardless of the speed of your model, the AI SDK is designed to make implementing streaming UIs as simple as possible. In the example below, we stream text generation from OpenAI's `gpt-4.1` in under 10 lines of code using the SDK's [`streamText`](/docs/reference/ai-sdk-core/stream-text) function:

```ts
import { streamText } from 'ai';
__PROVIDER_IMPORT__;

const { textStream } = streamText({
  model: __MODEL__,
  prompt: 'Write a poem about embedding models.',
});

for await (const textPart of textStream) {
  console.log(textPart);
}
```

For an introduction to streaming UIs and the AI SDK, check out our [Getting Started guides](/docs/getting-started).

# Choosing a Provider

The AI SDK supports dozens of model providers through [first-party](/providers/ai-sdk-providers), [OpenAI-compatible](/providers/openai-compatible-providers), and [community](/providers/community-providers) packages.

```ts
import { generateText } from 'ai';
__PROVIDER_IMPORT__;

const { text } = await generateText({
  model: __MODEL__,
  prompt: 'What is love?',
});
```

## AI Gateway

The [Vercel AI Gateway](/providers/ai-sdk-providers/ai-gateway) is the fastest way to get started with the AI SDK. Access models from OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, and other providers. Authenticate with [OIDC](https://ai-sdk.dev/providers/ai-sdk-providers/ai-gateway#oidc-authentication-vercel-deployments) or an AI Gateway API key

<div className="max-w-[40%] mx-auto">
  <ButtonLink
    href="https://vercel.com/d?to=%2F%5Bteam%5D%2F%7E%2Fai%2Fapi-keys%3Futm_source%3Dgateway-models-page%26showCreateKeyModal%3Dtrue&title=Get+Started+with+Vercel+AI+Gateway"
    shape="rounded"
    size="large"
    type="default"
    prefix={<VercelIcon />}
  >
    Get an API Key
  </ButtonLink>
</div>

Add your API key to your environment:

```env filename=".env.local"
AI_GATEWAY_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
```

The AI Gateway is the default [global provider](/docs/ai-sdk-core/provider-management#global-provider-configuration), so you can access models using a simple string:

```ts
import { generateText } from 'ai';

const { text } = await generateText({
  model: 'anthropic/claude-sonnet-4.5',
  prompt: 'What is love?',
});
```

You can also explicitly import and use the gateway provider:

```ts
// Option 1: Import from 'ai' package (included by default)
import { gateway } from 'ai';
model: gateway('anthropic/claude-sonnet-4.5');

// Option 2: Install and import from '@ai-sdk/gateway' package
import { gateway } from '@ai-sdk/gateway';
model: gateway('anthropic/claude-sonnet-4.5');
```

## Using Dedicated Providers

You can also use [first-party](/providers/ai-sdk-providers), [OpenAI-compatible](/providers/openai-compatible-providers), and [community](/providers/community-providers) provider packages directly. Install the package and create a provider instance. For example, to use Anthropic:

<div className="my-4">
  <Tabs items={['pnpm', 'npm', 'yarn', 'bun']}>
    <Tab>
      <Snippet text="pnpm add @ai-sdk/anthropic" dark />
    </Tab>
    <Tab>
      <Snippet text="npm install @ai-sdk/anthropic" dark />
    </Tab>
    <Tab>
      <Snippet text="yarn add @ai-sdk/anthropic" dark />
    </Tab>
    <Tab>
      <Snippet text="bun add @ai-sdk/anthropic" dark />
    </Tab>
  </Tabs>
</div>

```ts
import { anthropic } from '@ai-sdk/anthropic';

model: anthropic('claude-sonnet-4-5');
```

You can change the default global provider so string model references use your preferred provider everywhere in your application. Learn more about [provider management](/docs/ai-sdk-core/provider-management#global-provider-configuration).

See [available providers](/providers/ai-sdk-providers) for setup instructions for each provider.

## Custom Providers

You can build your own provider to integrate any service with the AI SDK. The AI SDK provides a [Language Model Specification](https://github.com/vercel/ai/tree/main/packages/provider/src/language-model/v3) that ensures compatibility across providers.

```ts
import { generateText } from 'ai';
import { yourProvider } from 'your-custom-provider';

const { text } = await generateText({
  model: yourProvider('your-model-id'),
  prompt: 'What is love?',
});
```

See [Writing a Custom Provider](/providers/community-providers/custom-providers) for a complete guide.

# Node.js Quickstart

The AI SDK is a powerful Typescript library designed to help developers build AI-powered applications.

In this quickstart tutorial, you'll build a simple agent with a streaming chat user interface. Along the way, you'll learn key concepts and techniques that are fundamental to using the SDK in your own projects.

If you are unfamiliar with the concepts of [Prompt Engineering](/docs/advanced/prompt-engineering) and [HTTP Streaming](/docs/advanced/why-streaming), you can optionally read these documents first.

## Prerequisites

To follow this quickstart, you'll need:

- Node.js 18+ and pnpm installed on your local development machine.
- A [ Vercel AI Gateway ](https://vercel.com/ai-gateway) API key.

If you haven't obtained your Vercel AI Gateway API key, you can do so by [signing up](https://vercel.com/d?to=%2F%5Bteam%5D%2F%7E%2Fai&title=Go+to+AI+Gateway) on the Vercel website.

## Setup Your Application

Start by creating a new directory using the `mkdir` command. Change into your new directory and then run the `pnpm init` command. This will create a `package.json` in your new directory.

```bash
mkdir my-ai-app
cd my-ai-app
pnpm init
```

### Install Dependencies

Install `ai`, the AI SDK, along with other necessary dependencies.

<Note>
  The AI SDK is designed to be a unified interface to interact with any large
  language model. This means that you can change model and providers with just
  one line of code! Learn more about [available providers](/providers) and
  [building custom providers](/providers/community-providers/custom-providers)
  in the [providers](/providers) section.
</Note>

```bash
pnpm add ai zod dotenv
pnpm add -D @types/node tsx typescript
```

The `ai` package contains the AI SDK. You will use `zod` to define type-safe schemas that you will pass to the large language model (LLM). You will use `dotenv` to access environment variables (your Vercel AI Gateway key) within your application. There are also three development dependencies, installed with the `-D` flag, that are necessary to run your Typescript code.

### Configure Vercel AI Gateway API key

Create a `.env` file in your project's root directory and add your Vercel AI Gateway API Key. This key is used to authenticate your application with the Vercel AI Gateway service.

<Snippet text="touch .env" />

Edit the `.env` file:

```env filename=".env"
AI_GATEWAY_API_KEY=xxxxxxxxx
```

Replace `xxxxxxxxx` with your actual Vercel AI Gateway API key.

<Note className="mb-4">
  The AI SDK will use the `AI_GATEWAY_API_KEY` environment variable to
  authenticate with Vercel AI Gateway.
</Note>

## Create Your Application

Create an `index.ts` file in the root of your project and add the following code:

```ts filename="index.ts"
import { ModelMessage, streamText } from 'ai';
__PROVIDER_IMPORT__;
import 'dotenv/config';
import * as readline from 'node:readline/promises';

const terminal = readline.createInterface({
  input: process.stdin,
  output: process.stdout,
});

const messages: ModelMessage[] = [];

async function main() {
  while (true) {
    const userInput = await terminal.question('You: ');

    messages.push({ role: 'user', content: userInput });

    const result = streamText({
      model: __MODEL__,
      messages,
    });

    let fullResponse = '';
    process.stdout.write('\nAssistant: ');
    for await (const delta of result.textStream) {
      fullResponse += delta;
      process.stdout.write(delta);
    }
    process.stdout.write('\n\n');

    messages.push({ role: 'assistant', content: fullResponse });
  }
}

main().catch(console.error);
```

Let's take a look at what is happening in this code:

1. Set up a readline interface to take input from the terminal, enabling interactive sessions directly from the command line.
2. Initialize an array called `messages` to store the history of your conversation. This history allows the agent to maintain context in ongoing dialogues.
3. In the `main` function:

- Prompt for and capture user input, storing it in `userInput`.
- Add user input to the `messages` array as a user message.
- Call [`streamText`](/docs/reference/ai-sdk-core/stream-text), which is imported from the `ai` package. This function accepts a configuration object that contains a `model` provider and `messages`.
- Iterate over the text stream returned by the `streamText` function (`result.textStream`) and print the contents of the stream to the terminal.
- Add the assistant's response to the `messages` array.

## Running Your Application

With that, you have built everything you need for your agent! To start your application, use the command:

<Snippet text="pnpm tsx index.ts" />

You should see a prompt in your terminal. Test it out by entering a message and see the AI agent respond in real-time! The AI SDK makes it fast and easy to build AI chat interfaces with Node.js.

## Choosing a Provider

The AI SDK supports dozens of model providers through [first-party](/providers/ai-sdk-providers), [OpenAI-compatible](/providers/openai-compatible-providers), and [ community ](/providers/community-providers) packages.

This quickstart uses the [Vercel AI Gateway](https://vercel.com/ai-gateway) provider, which is the default [global provider](/docs/ai-sdk-core/provider-management#global-provider-configuration). This means you can access models using a simple string in the model configuration:

```ts
model: __MODEL__;
```

You can also explicitly import and use the gateway provider in two other equivalent ways:

```ts
// Option 1: Import from 'ai' package (included by default)
import { gateway } from 'ai';
model: gateway('anthropic/claude-sonnet-4.5');

// Option 2: Install and import from '@ai-sdk/gateway' package
import { gateway } from '@ai-sdk/gateway';
model: gateway('anthropic/claude-sonnet-4.5');
```

### Using other providers

To use a different provider, install its package and create a provider instance. For example, to use OpenAI directly:

<div className="my-4">
  <Tabs items={['pnpm', 'npm', 'yarn', 'bun']}>
    <Tab>
      <Snippet text="pnpm add @ai-sdk/openai" dark />
    </Tab>
    <Tab>
      <Snippet text="npm install @ai-sdk/openai" dark />
    </Tab>
    <Tab>
      <Snippet text="yarn add @ai-sdk/openai" dark />
    </Tab>

    <Tab>
      <Snippet text="bun add @ai-sdk/openai" dark />
    </Tab>

  </Tabs>
</div>

```ts
import { openai } from '@ai-sdk/openai';

model: openai('gpt-5.1');
```

## Enhance Your Agent with Tools

While large language models (LLMs) have incredible generation capabilities, they struggle with discrete tasks (e.g. mathematics) and interacting with the outside world (e.g. getting the weather). This is where [tools](/docs/ai-sdk-core/tools-and-tool-calling) come in.

Tools are actions that an LLM can invoke. The results of these actions can be reported back to the LLM to be considered in the next response.

For example, if a user asks about the current weather, without tools, the agent would only be able to provide general information based on its training data. But with a weather tool, it can fetch and provide up-to-date, location-specific weather information.

Let's enhance your agent by adding a simple weather tool.

### Update Your Application

Modify your `index.ts` file to include the new weather tool:

```ts filename="index.ts" highlight="2,4,24-37"
import { ModelMessage, streamText, tool } from 'ai';
__PROVIDER_IMPORT__;
import 'dotenv/config';
import { z } from 'zod';
import * as readline from 'node:readline/promises';

const terminal = readline.createInterface({
  input: process.stdin,
  output: process.stdout,
});

const messages: ModelMessage[] = [];

async function main() {
  while (true) {
    const userInput = await terminal.question('You: ');

    messages.push({ role: 'user', content: userInput });

    const result = streamText({
      model: __MODEL__,
      messages,
      tools: {
        weather: tool({
          description: 'Get the weather in a location (fahrenheit)',
          inputSchema: z.object({
            location: z
              .string()
              .describe('The location to get the weather for'),
          }),
          execute: async ({ location }) => {
            const temperature = Math.round(Math.random() * (90 - 32) + 32);
            return {
              location,
              temperature,
            };
          },
        }),
      },
    });

    let fullResponse = '';
    process.stdout.write('\nAssistant: ');
    for await (const delta of result.textStream) {
      fullResponse += delta;
      process.stdout.write(delta);
    }
    process.stdout.write('\n\n');

    messages.push({ role: 'assistant', content: fullResponse });
  }
}

main().catch(console.error);
```

In this updated code:

1. You import the `tool` function from the `ai` package.
2. You define a `tools` object with a `weather` tool. This tool:

   - Has a description that helps the agent understand when to use it.
   - Defines `inputSchema` using a Zod schema, specifying that it requires a `location` string to execute this tool. The agent will attempt to extract this input from the context of the conversation. If it can't, it will ask the user for the missing information.
   - Defines an `execute` function that simulates getting weather data (in this case, it returns a random temperature). This is an asynchronous function running on the server so you can fetch real data from an external API.

Now your agent can "fetch" weather information for any location the user asks about. When the agent determines it needs to use the weather tool, it will generate a tool call with the necessary parameters. The `execute` function will then be automatically run, and the results will be used by the agent to generate its response.

Try asking something like "What's the weather in New York?" and see how the agent uses the new tool.

Notice the blank "assistant" response? This is because instead of generating a text response, the agent generated a tool call. You can access the tool call and subsequent tool result in the `toolCall` and `toolResult` keys of the result object.

```typescript highlight="46-47"
import { ModelMessage, streamText, tool } from 'ai';
__PROVIDER_IMPORT__;
import 'dotenv/config';
import { z } from 'zod';
import * as readline from 'node:readline/promises';

const terminal = readline.createInterface({
  input: process.stdin,
  output: process.stdout,
});

const messages: ModelMessage[] = [];

async function main() {
  while (true) {
    const userInput = await terminal.question('You: ');

    messages.push({ role: 'user', content: userInput });

    const result = streamText({
      model: __MODEL__,
      messages,
      tools: {
        weather: tool({
          description: 'Get the weather in a location (fahrenheit)',
          inputSchema: z.object({
            location: z
              .string()
              .describe('The location to get the weather for'),
          }),
          execute: async ({ location }) => {
            const temperature = Math.round(Math.random() * (90 - 32) + 32);
            return {
              location,
              temperature,
            };
          },
        }),
      },
    });

    let fullResponse = '';
    process.stdout.write('\nAssistant: ');
    for await (const delta of result.textStream) {
      fullResponse += delta;
      process.stdout.write(delta);
    }
    process.stdout.write('\n\n');

    console.log(await result.toolCalls);
    console.log(await result.toolResults);
    messages.push({ role: 'assistant', content: fullResponse });
  }
}

main().catch(console.error);
```

Now, when you ask about the weather, you'll see the tool call and its result displayed in your chat interface.

## Enabling Multi-Step Tool Calls

You may have noticed that while the tool results are visible in the chat interface, the agent isn't using this information to answer your original query. This is because once the agent generates a tool call, it has technically completed its generation.

To solve this, you can enable multi-step tool calls using `stopWhen`. This feature will automatically send tool results back to the agent to trigger an additional generation until the stopping condition you define is met. In this case, you want the agent to answer your question using the results from the weather tool.

### Update Your Application

Modify your `index.ts` file to configure stopping conditions with `stopWhen`:

```ts filename="index.ts" highlight="38-41"
import { ModelMessage, streamText, tool, stepCountIs } from 'ai';
__PROVIDER_IMPORT__;
import 'dotenv/config';
import { z } from 'zod';
import * as readline from 'node:readline/promises';

const terminal = readline.createInterface({
  input: process.stdin,
  output: process.stdout,
});

const messages: ModelMessage[] = [];

async function main() {
  while (true) {
    const userInput = await terminal.question('You: ');

    messages.push({ role: 'user', content: userInput });

    const result = streamText({
      model: __MODEL__,
      messages,
      tools: {
        weather: tool({
          description: 'Get the weather in a location (fahrenheit)',
          inputSchema: z.object({
            location: z
              .string()
              .describe('The location to get the weather for'),
          }),
          execute: async ({ location }) => {
            const temperature = Math.round(Math.random() * (90 - 32) + 32);
            return {
              location,
              temperature,
            };
          },
        }),
      },
      stopWhen: stepCountIs(5),
      onStepFinish: async ({ toolResults }) => {
        if (toolResults.length) {
          console.log(JSON.stringify(toolResults, null, 2));
        }
      },
    });

    let fullResponse = '';
    process.stdout.write('\nAssistant: ');
    for await (const delta of result.textStream) {
      fullResponse += delta;
      process.stdout.write(delta);
    }
    process.stdout.write('\n\n');

    messages.push({ role: 'assistant', content: fullResponse });
  }
}

main().catch(console.error);
```

In this updated code:

1. You set `stopWhen` to be when `stepCountIs` 5, allowing the agent to use up to 5 "steps" for any given generation.
2. You add an `onStepFinish` callback to log any `toolResults` from each step of the interaction, helping you understand the agent's tool usage. This means we can also delete the `toolCall` and `toolResult` `console.log` statements from the previous example.

Now, when you ask about the weather in a location, you should see the agent using the weather tool results to answer your question.

By setting `stopWhen: stepCountIs(5)`, you're allowing the agent to use up to 5 "steps" for any given generation. This enables more complex interactions and allows the agent to gather and process information over several steps if needed. You can see this in action by adding another tool to convert the temperature from Celsius to Fahrenheit.

### Adding a second tool

Update your `index.ts` file to add a new tool to convert the temperature from Celsius to Fahrenheit:

```ts filename="index.ts" highlight="37-48"
import { ModelMessage, streamText, tool, stepCountIs } from 'ai';
__PROVIDER_IMPORT__;
import 'dotenv/config';
import { z } from 'zod';
import * as readline from 'node:readline/promises';

const terminal = readline.createInterface({
  input: process.stdin,
  output: process.stdout,
});

const messages: ModelMessage[] = [];

async function main() {
  while (true) {
    const userInput = await terminal.question('You: ');

    messages.push({ role: 'user', content: userInput });

    const result = streamText({
      model: __MODEL__,
      messages,
      tools: {
        weather: tool({
          description: 'Get the weather in a location (fahrenheit)',
          inputSchema: z.object({
            location: z
              .string()
              .describe('The location to get the weather for'),
          }),
          execute: async ({ location }) => {
            const temperature = Math.round(Math.random() * (90 - 32) + 32);
            return {
              location,
              temperature,
            };
          },
        }),
        convertFahrenheitToCelsius: tool({
          description: 'Convert a temperature in fahrenheit to celsius',
          inputSchema: z.object({
            temperature: z
              .number()
              .describe('The temperature in fahrenheit to convert'),
          }),
          execute: async ({ temperature }) => {
            const celsius = Math.round((temperature - 32) * (5 / 9));
            return {
              celsius,
            };
          },
        }),
      },
      stopWhen: stepCountIs(5),
      onStepFinish: async ({ toolResults }) => {
        if (toolResults.length) {
          console.log(JSON.stringify(toolResults, null, 2));
        }
      },
    });

    let fullResponse = '';
    process.stdout.write('\nAssistant: ');
    for await (const delta of result.textStream) {
      fullResponse += delta;
      process.stdout.write(delta);
    }
    process.stdout.write('\n\n');

    messages.push({ role: 'assistant', content: fullResponse });
  }
}

main().catch(console.error);
```

Now, when you ask "What's the weather in New York in celsius?", you should see a more complete interaction:

1. The agent will call the weather tool for New York.
2. You'll see the tool result logged.
3. It will then call the temperature conversion tool to convert the temperature from Fahrenheit to Celsius.
4. The agent will then use that information to provide a natural language response about the weather in New York.

This multi-step approach allows the agent to gather information and use it to provide more accurate and contextual responses, making your agent considerably more useful.

This example demonstrates how tools can expand your agent's capabilities. You can create more complex tools to integrate with real APIs, databases, or any other external systems, allowing the agent to access and process real-world data in real-time and perform actions that interact with the outside world. Tools bridge the gap between the agent's knowledge cutoff and current information, while also enabling it to take meaningful actions beyond just generating text responses.

## Where to Next?

You've built an AI agent using the AI SDK! From here, you have several paths to explore:

- To learn more about the AI SDK, read through the [documentation](/docs).
- If you're interested in diving deeper with guides, check out the [RAG (retrieval-augmented generation)](/docs/guides/rag-chatbot) and [multi-modal chatbot](/docs/guides/multi-modal-chatbot) guides.
- To jumpstart your first AI project, explore available [templates](https://vercel.com/templates?type=ai).

# Agents

Agents are **large language models (LLMs)** that use **tools** in a **loop** to accomplish tasks.

These components work together:

- **LLMs** process input and decide the next action
- **Tools** extend capabilities beyond text generation (reading files, calling APIs, writing to databases)
- **Loop** orchestrates execution through:
  - **Context management** - Maintaining conversation history and deciding what the model sees (input) at each step
  - **Stopping conditions** - Determining when the loop (task) is complete

## ToolLoopAgent Class

The ToolLoopAgent class handles these three components. Here's an agent that uses multiple tools in a loop to accomplish a task:

```ts
import { ToolLoopAgent, stepCountIs, tool } from 'ai';
__PROVIDER_IMPORT__;
import { z } from 'zod';

const weatherAgent = new ToolLoopAgent({
  model: __MODEL__,
  tools: {
    weather: tool({
      description: 'Get the weather in a location (in Fahrenheit)',
      inputSchema: z.object({
        location: z.string().describe('The location to get the weather for'),
      }),
      execute: async ({ location }) => ({
        location,
        temperature: 72 + Math.floor(Math.random() * 21) - 10,
      }),
    }),
    convertFahrenheitToCelsius: tool({
      description: 'Convert temperature from Fahrenheit to Celsius',
      inputSchema: z.object({
        temperature: z.number().describe('Temperature in Fahrenheit'),
      }),
      execute: async ({ temperature }) => {
        const celsius = Math.round((temperature - 32) * (5 / 9));
        return { celsius };
      },
    }),
  },
  // Agent's default behavior is to stop after a maximum of 20 steps
  // stopWhen: stepCountIs(20),
});

const result = await weatherAgent.generate({
  prompt: 'What is the weather in San Francisco in celsius?',
});

console.log(result.text); // agent's final answer
console.log(result.steps); // steps taken by the agent
```

The agent automatically:

1. Calls the `weather` tool to get the temperature in Fahrenheit
2. Calls `convertFahrenheitToCelsius` to convert it
3. Generates a final text response with the result

The Agent class handles the loop, context management, and stopping conditions.

## Why Use the Agent Class?

The Agent class is the recommended approach for building agents with the AI SDK because it:

- **Reduces boilerplate** - Manages loops and message arrays
- **Improves reusability** - Define once, use throughout your application
- **Simplifies maintenance** - Single place to update agent configuration

For most use cases, start with the Agent class. Use core functions (`generateText`, `streamText`) when you need explicit control over each step for complex structured workflows.

## Structured Workflows

Agents are flexible and powerful, but non-deterministic. When you need reliable, repeatable outcomes with explicit control flow, use core functions with structured workflow patterns combining:

- Conditional statements for explicit branching
- Standard functions for reusable logic
- Error handling for robustness
- Explicit control flow for predictability

# Building Agents

The Agent class provides a structured way to encapsulate LLM configuration, tools, and behavior into reusable components. It handles the agent loop for you, allowing the LLM to call tools multiple times in sequence to accomplish complex tasks. Define agents once and use them across your application.

## Why Use the ToolLoopAgent Class?

When building AI applications, you often need to:

- **Reuse configurations** - Same model settings, tools, and prompts across different parts of your application
- **Maintain consistency** - Ensure the same behavior and capabilities throughout your codebase
- **Simplify API routes** - Reduce boilerplate in your endpoints
- **Type safety** - Get full TypeScript support for your agent's tools and outputs

The ToolLoopAgent class provides a single place to define your agent's behavior.

## Creating an Agent

Define an agent by instantiating the ToolLoopAgent class with your desired configuration:

```ts
import { ToolLoopAgent } from 'ai';
__PROVIDER_IMPORT__;

const myAgent = new ToolLoopAgent({
  model: __MODEL__,
  instructions: 'You are a helpful assistant.',
  tools: {
    // Your tools here
  },
});
```

## Configuration Options

The Agent class accepts all the same settings as `generateText` and `streamText`. Configure:

### Model and System Instructions

```ts
import { ToolLoopAgent } from 'ai';
__PROVIDER_IMPORT__;

const agent = new ToolLoopAgent({
  model: __MODEL__,
  instructions: 'You are an expert software engineer.',
});
```

### Tools

Provide tools that the agent can use to accomplish tasks:

```ts
import { ToolLoopAgent, tool } from 'ai';
__PROVIDER_IMPORT__;
import { z } from 'zod';

const codeAgent = new ToolLoopAgent({
  model: __MODEL__,
  tools: {
    runCode: tool({
      description: 'Execute Python code',
      inputSchema: z.object({
        code: z.string(),
      }),
      execute: async ({ code }) => {
        // Execute code and return result
        return { output: 'Code executed successfully' };
      },
    }),
  },
});
```

### Loop Control

By default, agents run for 20 steps (`stopWhen: stepCountIs(20)`). In each step, the model either generates text or calls a tool. If it generates text, the agent completes. If it calls a tool, the AI SDK executes that tool.

To let agents call multiple tools in sequence, configure `stopWhen` to allow more steps. After each tool execution, the agent triggers a new generation where the model can call another tool or generate text:

```ts
import { ToolLoopAgent, stepCountIs } from 'ai';
__PROVIDER_IMPORT__;

const agent = new ToolLoopAgent({
  model: __MODEL__,
  stopWhen: stepCountIs(20), // Allow up to 20 steps
});
```

Each step represents one generation (which results in either text or a tool call). The loop continues until:

- A finish reasoning other than tool-calls is returned, or
- A tool that is invoked does not have an execute function, or
- A tool call needs approval, or
- A stop condition is met

You can combine multiple conditions:

```ts
import { ToolLoopAgent, stepCountIs } from 'ai';
__PROVIDER_IMPORT__;

const agent = new ToolLoopAgent({
  model: __MODEL__,
  stopWhen: [
    stepCountIs(20), // Maximum 20 steps
    yourCustomCondition(), // Custom logic for when to stop
  ],
});
```

Learn more about [loop control and stop conditions](/docs/agents/loop-control).

### Tool Choice

Control how the agent uses tools:

```ts
import { ToolLoopAgent } from 'ai';
__PROVIDER_IMPORT__;

const agent = new ToolLoopAgent({
  model: __MODEL__,
  tools: {
    // your tools here
  },
  toolChoice: 'required', // Force tool use
  // or toolChoice: 'none' to disable tools
  // or toolChoice: 'auto' (default) to let the model decide
});
```

You can also force the use of a specific tool:

```ts
import { ToolLoopAgent } from 'ai';
__PROVIDER_IMPORT__;

const agent = new ToolLoopAgent({
  model: __MODEL__,
  tools: {
    weather: weatherTool,
    cityAttractions: attractionsTool,
  },
  toolChoice: {
    type: 'tool',
    toolName: 'weather', // Force the weather tool to be used
  },
});
```

### Structured Output

Define structured output schemas:

```ts
import { ToolLoopAgent, Output, stepCountIs } from 'ai';
__PROVIDER_IMPORT__;
import { z } from 'zod';

const analysisAgent = new ToolLoopAgent({
  model: __MODEL__,
  output: Output.object({
    schema: z.object({
      sentiment: z.enum(['positive', 'neutral', 'negative']),
      summary: z.string(),
      keyPoints: z.array(z.string()),
    }),
  }),
  stopWhen: stepCountIs(10),
});

const { output } = await analysisAgent.generate({
  prompt: 'Analyze customer feedback from the last quarter',
});
```

## Define Agent Behavior with System Instructions

System instructions define your agent's behavior, personality, and constraints. They set the context for all interactions and guide how the agent responds to user queries and uses tools.

### Basic System Instructions

Set the agent's role and expertise:

```ts
const agent = new ToolLoopAgent({
  model: __MODEL__,
  instructions:
    'You are an expert data analyst. You provide clear insights from complex data.',
});
```

### Detailed Behavioral Instructions

Provide specific guidelines for agent behavior:

```ts
const codeReviewAgent = new ToolLoopAgent({
  model: __MODEL__,
  instructions: `You are a senior software engineer conducting code reviews.

  Your approach:
  - Focus on security vulnerabilities first
  - Identify performance bottlenecks
  - Suggest improvements for readability and maintainability
  - Be constructive and educational in your feedback
  - Always explain why something is an issue and how to fix it`,
});
```

### Constrain Agent Behavior

Set boundaries and ensure consistent behavior:

```ts
const customerSupportAgent = new ToolLoopAgent({
  model: __MODEL__,
  instructions: `You are a customer support specialist for an e-commerce platform.

  Rules:
  - Never make promises about refunds without checking the policy
  - Always be empathetic and professional
  - If you don't know something, say so and offer to escalate
  - Keep responses concise and actionable
  - Never share internal company information`,
  tools: {
    checkOrderStatus,
    lookupPolicy,
    createTicket,
  },
});
```

### Tool Usage Instructions

Guide how the agent should use available tools:

```ts
const researchAgent = new ToolLoopAgent({
  model: __MODEL__,
  instructions: `You are a research assistant with access to search and document tools.

  When researching:
  1. Always start with a broad search to understand the topic
  2. Use document analysis for detailed information
  3. Cross-reference multiple sources before drawing conclusions
  4. Cite your sources when presenting information
  5. If information conflicts, present both viewpoints`,
  tools: {
    webSearch,
    analyzeDocument,
    extractQuotes,
  },
});
```

### Format and Style Instructions

Control the output format and communication style:

```ts
const technicalWriterAgent = new ToolLoopAgent({
  model: __MODEL__,
  instructions: `You are a technical documentation writer.

  Writing style:
  - Use clear, simple language
  - Avoid jargon unless necessary
  - Structure information with headers and bullet points
  - Include code examples where relevant
  - Write in second person ("you" instead of "the user")

  Always format responses in Markdown.`,
});
```

## Using an Agent

Once defined, you can use your agent in three ways:

### Generate Text

Use `generate()` for one-time text generation:

```ts
const result = await myAgent.generate({
  prompt: 'What is the weather like?',
});

console.log(result.text);
```

### Stream Text

Use `stream()` for streaming responses:

```ts
const stream = myAgent.stream({
  prompt: 'Tell me a story',
});

for await (const chunk of stream.textStream) {
  console.log(chunk);
}
```

### Respond to UI Messages

Use `createAgentUIStreamResponse()` to create API responses for client applications:

```ts
// In your API route (e.g., app/api/chat/route.ts)
import { createAgentUIStreamResponse } from 'ai';

export async function POST(request: Request) {
  const { messages } = await request.json();

  return createAgentUIStreamResponse({
    agent: myAgent,
    messages,
  });
}
```

## End-to-end Type Safety

You can infer types for your agent's `UIMessage`s:

```ts
import { ToolLoopAgent, InferAgentUIMessage } from 'ai';

const myAgent = new ToolLoopAgent({
  // ... configuration
});

// Infer the UIMessage type for UI components or persistence
export type MyAgentUIMessage = InferAgentUIMessage<typeof myAgent>;
```

Use this type in your client components with `useChat`:

```tsx filename="components/chat.tsx"
'use client';

import { useChat } from '@ai-sdk/react';
import type { MyAgentUIMessage } from '@/agent/my-agent';

export function Chat() {
  const { messages } = useChat<MyAgentUIMessage>();
  // Full type safety for your messages and tools
}
```

## Next Steps

Now that you understand building agents, you can:

- Explore [workflow patterns](/docs/agents/workflows) for structured patterns using core functions
- Learn about [loop control](/docs/agents/loop-control) for advanced execution control
- See [manual loop examples](/cookbook/node/manual-agent-loop) for custom workflow implementations

# Workflow Patterns

Combine the building blocks from the [overview](/docs/agents/overview) with these patterns to add structure and reliability to your agents:

- [Sequential Processing](#sequential-processing-chains) - Steps executed in order
- [Parallel Processing](#parallel-processing) - Independent tasks run simultaneously
- [Evaluation/Feedback Loops](#evaluator-optimizer) - Results checked and improved iteratively
- [Orchestration](#orchestrator-worker) - Coordinating multiple components
- [Routing](#routing) - Directing work based on context

## Choose Your Approach

Consider these key factors:

- **Flexibility vs Control** - How much freedom does the LLM need vs how tightly you must constrain its actions?
- **Error Tolerance** - What are the consequences of mistakes in your use case?
- **Cost Considerations** - More complex systems typically mean more LLM calls and higher costs
- **Maintenance** - Simpler architectures are easier to debug and modify

**Start with the simplest approach that meets your needs**. Add complexity only when required by:

1. Breaking down tasks into clear steps
2. Adding tools for specific capabilities
3. Implementing feedback loops for quality control
4. Introducing multiple agents for complex workflows

Let's look at examples of these patterns in action.

## Patterns with Examples

These patterns, adapted from [Anthropic's guide on building effective agents](https://www.anthropic.com/research/building-effective-agents), serve as building blocks you can combine to create comprehensive workflows. Each pattern addresses specific aspects of task execution. Combine them thoughtfully to build reliable solutions for complex problems.

## Sequential Processing (Chains)

The simplest workflow pattern executes steps in a predefined order. Each step's output becomes input for the next step, creating a clear chain of operations. Use this pattern for tasks with well-defined sequences, like content generation pipelines or data transformation processes.

```ts
import { generateText, generateObject } from 'ai';
__PROVIDER_IMPORT__;
import { z } from 'zod';

async function generateMarketingCopy(input: string) {
  const model = __MODEL__;

  // First step: Generate marketing copy
  const { text: copy } = await generateText({
    model,
    prompt: `Write persuasive marketing copy for: ${input}. Focus on benefits and emotional appeal.`,
  });

  // Perform quality check on copy
  const { object: qualityMetrics } = await generateObject({
    model,
    schema: z.object({
      hasCallToAction: z.boolean(),
      emotionalAppeal: z.number().min(1).max(10),
      clarity: z.number().min(1).max(10),
    }),
    prompt: `Evaluate this marketing copy for:
    1. Presence of call to action (true/false)
    2. Emotional appeal (1-10)
    3. Clarity (1-10)

    Copy to evaluate: ${copy}`,
  });

  // If quality check fails, regenerate with more specific instructions
  if (
    !qualityMetrics.hasCallToAction ||
    qualityMetrics.emotionalAppeal < 7 ||
    qualityMetrics.clarity < 7
  ) {
    const { text: improvedCopy } = await generateText({
      model,
      prompt: `Rewrite this marketing copy with:
      ${!qualityMetrics.hasCallToAction ? '- A clear call to action' : ''}
      ${qualityMetrics.emotionalAppeal < 7 ? '- Stronger emotional appeal' : ''}
      ${qualityMetrics.clarity < 7 ? '- Improved clarity and directness' : ''}

      Original copy: ${copy}`,
    });
    return { copy: improvedCopy, qualityMetrics };
  }

  return { copy, qualityMetrics };
}
```

## Routing

This pattern lets the model decide which path to take through a workflow based on context and intermediate results. The model acts as an intelligent router, directing the flow of execution between different branches of your workflow. Use this when handling varied inputs that require different processing approaches. In the example below, the first LLM call's results determine the second call's model size and system prompt.

```ts
import { generateObject, generateText } from 'ai';
__PROVIDER_IMPORT__;
import { z } from 'zod';

async function handleCustomerQuery(query: string) {
  const model = __MODEL__;

  // First step: Classify the query type
  const { object: classification } = await generateObject({
    model,
    schema: z.object({
      reasoning: z.string(),
      type: z.enum(['general', 'refund', 'technical']),
      complexity: z.enum(['simple', 'complex']),
    }),
    prompt: `Classify this customer query:
    ${query}

    Determine:
    1. Query type (general, refund, or technical)
    2. Complexity (simple or complex)
    3. Brief reasoning for classification`,
  });

  // Route based on classification
  // Set model and system prompt based on query type and complexity
  const { text: response } = await generateText({
    model:
      classification.complexity === 'simple'
        ? 'openai/gpt-4o-mini'
        : 'openai/o4-mini',
    system: {
      general:
        'You are an expert customer service agent handling general inquiries.',
      refund:
        'You are a customer service agent specializing in refund requests. Follow company policy and collect necessary information.',
      technical:
        'You are a technical support specialist with deep product knowledge. Focus on clear step-by-step troubleshooting.',
    }[classification.type],
    prompt: query,
  });

  return { response, classification };
}
```

## Parallel Processing

Break down tasks into independent subtasks that execute simultaneously. This pattern uses parallel execution to improve efficiency while maintaining the benefits of structured workflows. For example, analyze multiple documents or process different aspects of a single input concurrently (like code review).

```ts
import { generateText, generateObject } from 'ai';
__PROVIDER_IMPORT__;
import { z } from 'zod';

// Example: Parallel code review with multiple specialized reviewers
async function parallelCodeReview(code: string) {
  const model = __MODEL__;

  // Run parallel reviews
  const [securityReview, performanceReview, maintainabilityReview] =
    await Promise.all([
      generateObject({
        model,
        system:
          'You are an expert in code security. Focus on identifying security vulnerabilities, injection risks, and authentication issues.',
        schema: z.object({
          vulnerabilities: z.array(z.string()),
          riskLevel: z.enum(['low', 'medium', 'high']),
          suggestions: z.array(z.string()),
        }),
        prompt: `Review this code:
      ${code}`,
      }),

      generateObject({
        model,
        system:
          'You are an expert in code performance. Focus on identifying performance bottlenecks, memory leaks, and optimization opportunities.',
        schema: z.object({
          issues: z.array(z.string()),
          impact: z.enum(['low', 'medium', 'high']),
          optimizations: z.array(z.string()),
        }),
        prompt: `Review this code:
      ${code}`,
      }),

      generateObject({
        model,
        system:
          'You are an expert in code quality. Focus on code structure, readability, and adherence to best practices.',
        schema: z.object({
          concerns: z.array(z.string()),
          qualityScore: z.number().min(1).max(10),
          recommendations: z.array(z.string()),
        }),
        prompt: `Review this code:
      ${code}`,
      }),
    ]);

  const reviews = [
    { ...securityReview.object, type: 'security' },
    { ...performanceReview.object, type: 'performance' },
    { ...maintainabilityReview.object, type: 'maintainability' },
  ];

  // Aggregate results using another model instance
  const { text: summary } = await generateText({
    model,
    system: 'You are a technical lead summarizing multiple code reviews.',
    prompt: `Synthesize these code review results into a concise summary with key actions:
    ${JSON.stringify(reviews, null, 2)}`,
  });

  return { reviews, summary };
}
```

## Orchestrator-Worker

A primary model (orchestrator) coordinates the execution of specialized workers. Each worker optimizes for a specific subtask, while the orchestrator maintains overall context and ensures coherent results. This pattern excels at complex tasks requiring different types of expertise or processing.

```ts
import { generateObject } from 'ai';
__PROVIDER_IMPORT__;
import { z } from 'zod';

async function implementFeature(featureRequest: string) {
  // Orchestrator: Plan the implementation
  const { object: implementationPlan } = await generateObject({
    model: __MODEL__,
    schema: z.object({
      files: z.array(
        z.object({
          purpose: z.string(),
          filePath: z.string(),
          changeType: z.enum(['create', 'modify', 'delete']),
        }),
      ),
      estimatedComplexity: z.enum(['low', 'medium', 'high']),
    }),
    system:
      'You are a senior software architect planning feature implementations.',
    prompt: `Analyze this feature request and create an implementation plan:
    ${featureRequest}`,
  });

  // Workers: Execute the planned changes
  const fileChanges = await Promise.all(
    implementationPlan.files.map(async file => {
      // Each worker is specialized for the type of change
      const workerSystemPrompt = {
        create:
          'You are an expert at implementing new files following best practices and project patterns.',
        modify:
          'You are an expert at modifying existing code while maintaining consistency and avoiding regressions.',
        delete:
          'You are an expert at safely removing code while ensuring no breaking changes.',
      }[file.changeType];

      const { object: change } = await generateObject({
        model: __MODEL__,
        schema: z.object({
          explanation: z.string(),
          code: z.string(),
        }),
        system: workerSystemPrompt,
        prompt: `Implement the changes for ${file.filePath} to support:
        ${file.purpose}

        Consider the overall feature context:
        ${featureRequest}`,
      });

      return {
        file,
        implementation: change,
      };
    }),
  );

  return {
    plan: implementationPlan,
    changes: fileChanges,
  };
}
```

## Evaluator-Optimizer

Add quality control to workflows with dedicated evaluation steps that assess intermediate results. Based on the evaluation, the workflow proceeds, retries with adjusted parameters, or takes corrective action. This creates robust workflows capable of self-improvement and error recovery.

```ts
import { generateText, generateObject } from 'ai';
__PROVIDER_IMPORT__;
import { z } from 'zod';

async function translateWithFeedback(text: string, targetLanguage: string) {
  let currentTranslation = '';
  let iterations = 0;
  const MAX_ITERATIONS = 3;

  // Initial translation
  const { text: translation } = await generateText({
    model: __MODEL__,
    system: 'You are an expert literary translator.',
    prompt: `Translate this text to ${targetLanguage}, preserving tone and cultural nuances:
    ${text}`,
  });

  currentTranslation = translation;

  // Evaluation-optimization loop
  while (iterations < MAX_ITERATIONS) {
    // Evaluate current translation
    const { object: evaluation } = await generateObject({
      model: __MODEL__,
      schema: z.object({
        qualityScore: z.number().min(1).max(10),
        preservesTone: z.boolean(),
        preservesNuance: z.boolean(),
        culturallyAccurate: z.boolean(),
        specificIssues: z.array(z.string()),
        improvementSuggestions: z.array(z.string()),
      }),
      system: 'You are an expert in evaluating literary translations.',
      prompt: `Evaluate this translation:

      Original: ${text}
      Translation: ${currentTranslation}

      Consider:
      1. Overall quality
      2. Preservation of tone
      3. Preservation of nuance
      4. Cultural accuracy`,
    });

    // Check if quality meets threshold
    if (
      evaluation.qualityScore >= 8 &&
      evaluation.preservesTone &&
      evaluation.preservesNuance &&
      evaluation.culturallyAccurate
    ) {
      break;
    }

    // Generate improved translation based on feedback
    const { text: improvedTranslation } = await generateText({
      model: __MODEL__,
      system: 'You are an expert literary translator.',
      prompt: `Improve this translation based on the following feedback:
      ${evaluation.specificIssues.join('\n')}
      ${evaluation.improvementSuggestions.join('\n')}

      Original: ${text}
      Current Translation: ${currentTranslation}`,
    });

    currentTranslation = improvedTranslation;
    iterations++;
  }

  return {
    finalTranslation: currentTranslation,
    iterationsRequired: iterations,
  };
}
```


# Loop Control

You can control both the execution flow and the settings at each step of the agent loop. The loop continues until:

- A finish reasoning other than tool-calls is returned, or
- A tool that is invoked does not have an execute function, or
- A tool call needs approval, or
- A stop condition is met

The AI SDK provides built-in loop control through two parameters: `stopWhen` for defining stopping conditions and `prepareStep` for modifying settings (model, tools, messages, and more) between steps.

## Stop Conditions

The `stopWhen` parameter controls when to stop execution when there are tool results in the last step. By default, agents stop after 20 steps using `stepCountIs(20)`.

When you provide `stopWhen`, the agent continues executing after tool calls until a stopping condition is met. When the condition is an array, execution stops when any of the conditions are met.

### Use Built-in Conditions

The AI SDK provides several built-in stopping conditions:

```ts
import { ToolLoopAgent, stepCountIs } from 'ai';
__PROVIDER_IMPORT__;

const agent = new ToolLoopAgent({
  model: __MODEL__,
  tools: {
    // your tools
  },
  stopWhen: stepCountIs(20), // Default state: stop after 20 steps maximum
});

const result = await agent.generate({
  prompt: 'Analyze this dataset and create a summary report',
});
```

### Combine Multiple Conditions

Combine multiple stopping conditions. The loop stops when it meets any condition:

```ts
import { ToolLoopAgent, stepCountIs, hasToolCall } from 'ai';
__PROVIDER_IMPORT__;

const agent = new ToolLoopAgent({
  model: __MODEL__,
  tools: {
    // your tools
  },
  stopWhen: [
    stepCountIs(20), // Maximum 20 steps
    hasToolCall('someTool'), // Stop after calling 'someTool'
  ],
});

const result = await agent.generate({
  prompt: 'Research and analyze the topic',
});
```

### Create Custom Conditions

Build custom stopping conditions for specific requirements:

```ts
import { ToolLoopAgent, StopCondition, ToolSet } from 'ai';
__PROVIDER_IMPORT__;

const tools = {
  // your tools
} satisfies ToolSet;

const hasAnswer: StopCondition<typeof tools> = ({ steps }) => {
  // Stop when the model generates text containing "ANSWER:"
  return steps.some(step => step.text?.includes('ANSWER:')) ?? false;
};

const agent = new ToolLoopAgent({
  model: __MODEL__,
  tools,
  stopWhen: hasAnswer,
});

const result = await agent.generate({
  prompt: 'Find the answer and respond with "ANSWER: [your answer]"',
});
```

Custom conditions receive step information across all steps:

```ts
const budgetExceeded: StopCondition<typeof tools> = ({ steps }) => {
  const totalUsage = steps.reduce(
    (acc, step) => ({
      inputTokens: acc.inputTokens + (step.usage?.inputTokens ?? 0),
      outputTokens: acc.outputTokens + (step.usage?.outputTokens ?? 0),
    }),
    { inputTokens: 0, outputTokens: 0 },
  );

  const costEstimate =
    (totalUsage.inputTokens * 0.01 + totalUsage.outputTokens * 0.03) / 1000;
  return costEstimate > 0.5; // Stop if cost exceeds $0.50
};
```

## Prepare Step

The `prepareStep` callback runs before each step in the loop and defaults to the initial settings if you don't return any changes. Use it to modify settings, manage context, or implement dynamic behavior based on execution history.

### Dynamic Model Selection

Switch models based on step requirements:

```ts
import { ToolLoopAgent } from 'ai';
__PROVIDER_IMPORT__;

const agent = new ToolLoopAgent({
  model: 'openai/gpt-4o-mini', // Default model
  tools: {
    // your tools
  },
  prepareStep: async ({ stepNumber, messages }) => {
    // Use a stronger model for complex reasoning after initial steps
    if (stepNumber > 2 && messages.length > 10) {
      return {
        model: __MODEL__,
      };
    }
    // Continue with default settings
    return {};
  },
});

const result = await agent.generate({
  prompt: '...',
});
```

### Context Management

Manage growing conversation history in long-running loops:

```ts
import { ToolLoopAgent } from 'ai';
__PROVIDER_IMPORT__;

const agent = new ToolLoopAgent({
  model: __MODEL__,
  tools: {
    // your tools
  },
  prepareStep: async ({ messages }) => {
    // Keep only recent messages to stay within context limits
    if (messages.length > 20) {
      return {
        messages: [
          messages[0], // Keep system instructions
          ...messages.slice(-10), // Keep last 10 messages
        ],
      };
    }
    return {};
  },
});

const result = await agent.generate({
  prompt: '...',
});
```

### Tool Selection

Control which tools are available at each step:

```ts
import { ToolLoopAgent } from 'ai';
__PROVIDER_IMPORT__;

const agent = new ToolLoopAgent({
  model: __MODEL__,
  tools: {
    search: searchTool,
    analyze: analyzeTool,
    summarize: summarizeTool,
  },
  prepareStep: async ({ stepNumber, steps }) => {
    // Search phase (steps 0-2)
    if (stepNumber <= 2) {
      return {
        activeTools: ['search'],
        toolChoice: 'required',
      };
    }

    // Analysis phase (steps 3-5)
    if (stepNumber <= 5) {
      return {
        activeTools: ['analyze'],
      };
    }

    // Summary phase (step 6+)
    return {
      activeTools: ['summarize'],
      toolChoice: 'required',
    };
  },
});

const result = await agent.generate({
  prompt: '...',
});
```

You can also force a specific tool to be used:

```ts
prepareStep: async ({ stepNumber }) => {
  if (stepNumber === 0) {
    // Force the search tool to be used first
    return {
      toolChoice: { type: 'tool', toolName: 'search' },
    };
  }

  if (stepNumber === 5) {
    // Force the summarize tool after analysis
    return {
      toolChoice: { type: 'tool', toolName: 'summarize' },
    };
  }

  return {};
};
```

### Message Modification

Transform messages before sending them to the model:

```ts
import { ToolLoopAgent } from 'ai';
__PROVIDER_IMPORT__;

const agent = new ToolLoopAgent({
  model: __MODEL__,
  tools: {
    // your tools
  },
  prepareStep: async ({ messages, stepNumber }) => {
    // Summarize tool results to reduce token usage
    const processedMessages = messages.map(msg => {
      if (msg.role === 'tool' && msg.content.length > 1000) {
        return {
          ...msg,
          content: summarizeToolResult(msg.content),
        };
      }
      return msg;
    });

    return { messages: processedMessages };
  },
});

const result = await agent.generate({
  prompt: '...',
});
```

## Access Step Information

Both `stopWhen` and `prepareStep` receive detailed information about the current execution:

```ts
prepareStep: async ({
  model, // Current model configuration
  stepNumber, // Current step number (0-indexed)
  steps, // All previous steps with their results
  messages, // Messages to be sent to the model
}) => {
  // Access previous tool calls and results
  const previousToolCalls = steps.flatMap(step => step.toolCalls);
  const previousResults = steps.flatMap(step => step.toolResults);

  // Make decisions based on execution history
  if (previousToolCalls.some(call => call.toolName === 'dataAnalysis')) {
    return {
      toolChoice: { type: 'tool', toolName: 'reportGenerator' },
    };
  }

  return {};
},
```

## Manual Loop Control

For scenarios requiring complete control over the agent loop, you can use AI SDK Core functions (`generateText` and `streamText`) to implement your own loop management instead of using `stopWhen` and `prepareStep`. This approach provides maximum flexibility for complex workflows.

### Implementing a Manual Loop

Build your own agent loop when you need full control over execution:

```ts
import { generateText, ModelMessage } from 'ai';
__PROVIDER_IMPORT__;

const messages: ModelMessage[] = [{ role: 'user', content: '...' }];

let step = 0;
const maxSteps = 10;

while (step < maxSteps) {
  const result = await generateText({
    model: __MODEL__,
    messages,
    tools: {
      // your tools here
    },
  });

  messages.push(...result.response.messages);

  if (result.text) {
    break; // Stop when model generates text
  }

  step++;
}
```

This manual approach gives you complete control over:

- Message history management
- Step-by-step decision making
- Custom stopping conditions
- Dynamic tool and model selection
- Error handling and recovery

# Configuring Call Options

Call options allow you to pass type-safe structured inputs to your agent. Use them to dynamically modify any agent setting based on the specific request.

## Why Use Call Options?

When you need agent behavior to change based on runtime context:

- **Add dynamic context** - Inject retrieved documents, user preferences, or session data into prompts
- **Select models dynamically** - Choose faster or more capable models based on request complexity
- **Configure tools per request** - Pass user location to search tools or adjust tool behavior
- **Customize provider options** - Set reasoning effort, temperature, or other provider-specific settings

Without call options, you'd need to create multiple agents or handle configuration logic outside the agent.

## How It Works

Define call options in three steps:

1. **Define the schema** - Specify what inputs you accept using `callOptionsSchema`
2. **Configure with `prepareCall`** - Use those inputs to modify agent settings
3. **Pass options at runtime** - Provide the options when calling `generate()` or `stream()`

## Basic Example

Add user context to your agent's prompt at runtime:

```ts
import { ToolLoopAgent } from 'ai';
__PROVIDER_IMPORT__;
import { z } from 'zod';

const supportAgent = new ToolLoopAgent({
  model: __MODEL__,
  callOptionsSchema: z.object({
    userId: z.string(),
    accountType: z.enum(['free', 'pro', 'enterprise']),
  }),
  instructions: 'You are a helpful customer support agent.',
  prepareCall: ({ options, ...settings }) => ({
    ...settings,
    instructions:
      settings.instructions +
      `\nUser context:
- Account type: ${options.accountType}
- User ID: ${options.userId}

Adjust your response based on the user's account level.`,
  }),
});

// Call the agent with specific user context
const result = await supportAgent.generate({
  prompt: 'How do I upgrade my account?',
  options: {
    userId: 'user_123',
    accountType: 'free',
  },
});
```

The `options` parameter is now required and type-checked. If you don't provide it or pass incorrect types, TypeScript will error.

## Modifying Agent Settings

Use `prepareCall` to modify any agent setting. Return only the settings you want to change.

### Dynamic Model Selection

Choose models based on request characteristics:

```ts
import { ToolLoopAgent } from 'ai';
__PROVIDER_IMPORT__;
import { z } from 'zod';

const agent = new ToolLoopAgent({
  model: __MODEL__, // Default model
  callOptionsSchema: z.object({
    complexity: z.enum(['simple', 'complex']),
  }),
  prepareCall: ({ options, ...settings }) => ({
    ...settings,
    model:
      options.complexity === 'simple' ? 'openai/gpt-4o-mini' : 'openai/o1-mini',
  }),
});

// Use faster model for simple queries
await agent.generate({
  prompt: 'What is 2+2?',
  options: { complexity: 'simple' },
});

// Use more capable model for complex reasoning
await agent.generate({
  prompt: 'Explain quantum entanglement',
  options: { complexity: 'complex' },
});
```

### Dynamic Tool Configuration

Configure tools based on runtime context:

```ts
import { openai } from '@ai-sdk/openai';
import { ToolLoopAgent } from 'ai';
__PROVIDER_IMPORT__;
import { z } from 'zod';

const newsAgent = new ToolLoopAgent({
  model: __MODEL__,
  callOptionsSchema: z.object({
    userCity: z.string().optional(),
    userRegion: z.string().optional(),
  }),
  tools: {
    web_search: openai.tools.webSearch(),
  },
  prepareCall: ({ options, ...settings }) => ({
    ...settings,
    tools: {
      web_search: openai.tools.webSearch({
        searchContextSize: 'low',
        userLocation: {
          type: 'approximate',
          city: options.userCity,
          region: options.userRegion,
          country: 'US',
        },
      }),
    },
  }),
});

await newsAgent.generate({
  prompt: 'What are the top local news stories?',
  options: {
    userCity: 'San Francisco',
    userRegion: 'California',
  },
});
```

### Provider-Specific Options

Configure provider settings dynamically:

```ts
import { openai, OpenAIProviderOptions } from '@ai-sdk/openai';
import { ToolLoopAgent } from 'ai';
import { z } from 'zod';

const agent = new ToolLoopAgent({
  model: 'openai/o3',
  callOptionsSchema: z.object({
    taskDifficulty: z.enum(['low', 'medium', 'high']),
  }),
  prepareCall: ({ options, ...settings }) => ({
    ...settings,
    providerOptions: {
      openai: {
        reasoningEffort: options.taskDifficulty,
      } satisfies OpenAIProviderOptions,
    },
  }),
});

await agent.generate({
  prompt: 'Analyze this complex scenario...',
  options: { taskDifficulty: 'high' },
});
```

## Advanced Patterns

### Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)

Fetch relevant context and inject it into your prompt:

```ts
import { ToolLoopAgent } from 'ai';
__PROVIDER_IMPORT__;
import { z } from 'zod';

const ragAgent = new ToolLoopAgent({
  model: __MODEL__,
  callOptionsSchema: z.object({
    query: z.string(),
  }),
  prepareCall: async ({ options, ...settings }) => {
    // Fetch relevant documents (this can be async)
    const documents = await vectorSearch(options.query);

    return {
      ...settings,
      instructions: `Answer questions using the following context:

${documents.map(doc => doc.content).join('\n\n')}`,
    };
  },
});

await ragAgent.generate({
  prompt: 'What is our refund policy?',
  options: { query: 'refund policy' },
});
```

The `prepareCall` function can be async, enabling you to fetch data before configuring the agent.

### Combining Multiple Modifications

Modify multiple settings together:

```ts
import { ToolLoopAgent } from 'ai';
__PROVIDER_IMPORT__;
import { z } from 'zod';

const agent = new ToolLoopAgent({
  model: __MODEL__,
  callOptionsSchema: z.object({
    userRole: z.enum(['admin', 'user']),
    urgency: z.enum(['low', 'high']),
  }),
  tools: {
    readDatabase: readDatabaseTool,
    writeDatabase: writeDatabaseTool,
  },
  prepareCall: ({ options, ...settings }) => ({
    ...settings,
    // Upgrade model for urgent requests
    model: options.urgency === 'high' ? __MODEL__ : settings.model,
    // Limit tools based on user role
    activeTools:
      options.userRole === 'admin'
        ? ['readDatabase', 'writeDatabase']
        : ['readDatabase'],
    // Adjust instructions
    instructions: `You are a ${options.userRole} assistant.
${options.userRole === 'admin' ? 'You have full database access.' : 'You have read-only access.'}`,
  }),
});

await agent.generate({
  prompt: 'Update the user record',
  options: {
    userRole: 'admin',
    urgency: 'high',
  },
});
```

## Using with createAgentUIStreamResponse

Pass call options through API routes to your agent:

```ts filename="app/api/chat/route.ts"
import { createAgentUIStreamResponse } from 'ai';
import { myAgent } from '@/ai/agents/my-agent';

export async function POST(request: Request) {
  const { messages, userId, accountType } = await request.json();

  return createAgentUIStreamResponse({
    agent: myAgent,
    messages,
    options: {
      userId,
      accountType,
    },
  });
}
```
